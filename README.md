#PROJECT BY TREESA GEORGE AS THE PART OF "RADAR"

           print(‚ÄùHello World!‚Äù)

In the past few sessions we learnt about IDEs, the Terminal, Git & GitHub - all of which are tools that assist a programmer in writing/managing code. In contrast, the last two sessions gave us a peek at what a programmer actually does - Programming. Put simply, programming is the process of giving a set of instructions to a computer to achieve a specific task. Think of a scenario where you need to cook your favorite dish, you grab a recipe book, find the recipe, read the instructions and execute them sequentially to get the desired result - here you can be thought of as the computer and the recipe's author, the programmer. If you know how to give the right instructions, computers can get almost anything done for you ü§ñ
In today's session we looked at the basics of programming with Python - A high-level, multi paradigm, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically typed programming language (yeah, that‚Äôs a lot of jargon, but you can google it up if curious). It is beginner friendly, has an easy to understand syntax and has a ton of libraries and frameworks used for all sorts of purposes - automations, web developments, AI & ML etc. But regardless of the language you choose to start your programming journey, the fundamental skill you need to develop is 'problem solving' - the ability to analyze a problem and come up with alternative and creative solutions to it. How do you do that? By building projects, today's task would be your first project and the first step in learning programming the right way - by creating solutions to real problems ‚ö°

                 Task Brief

Create a simple calculator program. Take two numbers as the first input. Ask for the operator as the second input, use if and else conditions to perform the corresponding operation and display the result, for example if the operator is "+" then perform addition, if it's "/" do division and so on. 
Optional: Try adding more operations like exponentiation(**), floor division(//) & modulus/remainder(%) operations.
Once you've completed writing the program, save it as a python file (.py extension). Next create a new repository on your GitHub profile with the name trajectory-python-task and upload your file to it. Additionaly you can add a README file with screenshots of your program execution and also a short description of it's working. Once the repository is ready, copy the repo link and submit it in the below form.
